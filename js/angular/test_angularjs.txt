How to use?
===========


You can import ``angular`` from ``js.angular`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.angular import angular
  >>> angular.need()

  >>> from js.angular import (
  ...     angular,
  ...     angular_animate,
  ...     angular_cookies,
  ...     angular_loader,
  ...     angular_mocks,
  ...     angular_resource,
  ...     angular_route,
  ...     angular_sanitize,
  ...     angular_scenario,
  ... )
